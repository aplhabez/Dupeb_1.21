# Dupeb_1.21
DUPE, working in 2022 sept. Requires either brewing stands, enchanting tables and/or jerry npc

Currently trying hard to code a flipping bot aswell but that shit's hard, has an upcoming update with value per chest + total island value wich scans every chest on an island.


For now you just need to have about 5m+ to buy perfect gemstones or inferno vortex's, tarantula silk, purple candy. 
List of all the dupeable items ( almost all bz items, no cosmetics or skins)

If you don't trust this don't download it. Will definitely get you banned selling too much items.
will get patched soon but will try to update once i find new dupes or when i am motivated to do an ah flip mod

/dupe_item_XXXXXXX
XXXXXX stands for the item you want to dupe, don't type spaces but type _'s otherwise it will say command invalid
Don't abuse it too much or i will have to put it at a paid mod :)
